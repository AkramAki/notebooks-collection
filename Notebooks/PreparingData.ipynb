    "### 1.1.4 Feature Scaling with `StandardScaler`\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are sensitive to the scale of input features. If one variable spans values in the thousands while another ranges between 0 and 1, the network may struggle to converge efficiently. This is because internal weights can fluctuate wildly to compensate for imbalanced magnitudes across dimensions.\n",

    "To ensure that each feature contributes equally to the model during training, it's common practice to **scale and center** the data.\n",
